void StartButton(){
// extra code that hides the start button when clicking.  
 StartButton.hide();
  }
  //Reflection button.
  // the start button at first were 2 buttons, when 1 was clicked 3/4 times in rapid succession a bug would show in the console saying the button was already there and the second button would replace the first one.
  // however having a inconsistent start button that you would have to press 3/4/5 times, was inconsistant, luckily a fellow student had shown me a easy fix which i knew was there but didnt know how to implement it.
  // i was close to fixing it myself however my placement was off resulting in a break in the code.
